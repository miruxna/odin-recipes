        <p>Breakfast in Italy is a sweet and enjoyable awakening routine for body and mind. Don’t you feel like you’re in heaven when you open up your eyes in the morning, the coffee machine in the kitchen is mumbling and your house smells like coffee? Or maybe it’s not coffee but the smell of fresh-baked croissants, or freshly squeezed oranges: there are many different habits in Italy, but they all can be defined as Mediterranean breakfast or Italian Breakfast.</p>
        <p>There are also savoury breakfast lovers, they start the day with an English breakfast made with eggs, bacon and toast, or people who love typical American sweets like muffins and pancakes. However, our made in Italy breakfasts are one of a kind and they can also become a cure-all for health if we adopt some precautions.</p>
