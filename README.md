The current project is setting up a website for Italian recipes.
For the moment it's gonna be just html, so it'll look quite shitty, but we're gonna add css soon enough I guess.
Once completed, I'll demonstrate that I know how to set up a repository on github, clone it onto my local machine, but also make an index html page and various other webpages.
