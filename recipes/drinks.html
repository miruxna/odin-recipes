            <h3 class="newidea">What is an <i>aperitivo</i> in Italy?</h3>

            <p>More than just the Italian equivalent of happy hour, aperitivo is that blissful moment between the end of work and the business of dinner. It is a time to catch up with friends, enjoy a well-earned cocktail, and simply reflect on the day and future plans. The Italian aperitivo is about recognizing that the productive part of the day is done. Is the delineation between your work obligations and your personal time. Aperitivo is usually available from about 5 pm to 8 pm. After 8, it is time to start thinking about a real meal.</p>
            <p>But don’t expect happy hour prices! Drinks served for aperitivo in Italy can often be a little bit MORE expensive rather than less. This is because of the food that accompanies the drink. You can’t really be expected to whet your appetite without a few snacks, now can you?</p>
