        <h3>What do Italians eat for dessert?</h3>

        <p>Italy is known for its history, dream destinations, cuisine, and cultural heritage. There are so many iconic and world famous dishes that it’s difficult to choose one, but today we will talk about some of its culinary delights: desserts. Italian culture is known for enjoying the pleasures of life, having its own rhythm and lifestyle, and for putting the delight of the senses as a priority.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We’re Italians and so, it goes without saying that we adore food.  For us, dessert or dolce as we call it, is as important a course as any other. At Rinuccini, we’ve created a dessert menu of classic Italian desserts made with our own unique twist. We focus on simplicity and flavour and we’re proud that we make our desserts right here in our kitchens in Kilkenny.</p>
